Note that at the beginning of the trajectory the methoxide nucleophile weakly interacts with C-H bonds adjacent to the C-Br bond. The corresponding E2 trajectory animation shows the competitive E2 reaction. The SN2 and E2 trajectories are competitive because their transition states are close in energy."))

Rather, reactants often collide and bounce away from each other in what is referred to as a nonproductive collision. This trajectory shows an example where a cyanide anion collides with chloroethane without leading to the SN2 transition state.

Use the transition state (TS) button to examine key distances: the base to the beta hydrogen, the C-2 to C-3 distance, and the C-Br distance."))
